# LifeSimulation
This project implemented a solution for demonstrating life simulation (Conway's Game of Life). 
You can change the scale of the 2D universe and the population density of the first generation.

The Resolution parameter is responsible for the scale of the 2D universe. The Density parameter is responsible for the population density during the generation of the first generation. Resolution and density parameters have a minimum value - 2, a maximum value - 20.


You can also add new and remove old inhabitants to the generated universe using the left and right mouse buttons, respectively (hold and move).
